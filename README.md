# Color Frequency Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze the frequency of colors worn by staff at Bincom ICT throughout the week. The analysis is based on data extracted from a simulated HTML table showing the colors of dresses worn each day.

## Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Python Script**: The `color_frequency_analysis.py` script analyzes the color data extracted from the HTML table. It calculates various statistics such as the mean color, median color, variance of color choices, and the probability of selecting a specific color randomly.

2. **README**: This README file provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the Python script, explanations of how to interpret the results, and future enhancements.

## Running the Script

To run the `color_frequency_analysis.py` script:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script using `python color_frequency_analysis.py`.

## Results Interpretation

The script calculates the following statistics based on the color data:

1. **Mean Color**: The most commonly worn color throughout the week.
2. **Median Color**: The color that appears at the middle point when colors are sorted by frequency.
3. **Variance of Color Choices**: A measure of spread or diversity in color choices.
4. **Probability of Selecting a Color**: The likelihood of selecting a specific color randomly.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement data visualization to display color frequency statistics.
- Expand the analysis to include trends over multiple weeks or months.
